# Contributing.

We don't have any rules yet.

File [issues](https://github.com/svidgen/ex-gratia/issues) if you find bugs or have ideas. We'd love to grow this project and find as many ways as possible for open source site owners to recognize and share the wealth with their contributors.

Contribute PR's if you can. PR's that directly address an issue with massive public demand or which we've acknowlegded and/or approved are more likely to be reviewed and merged.

In all things, our guiding rule is this:

### Ex-Gratia must be as maintenance-free as possible for owners and contributors.

Site owners should not have to jump through hoops or take on legal or tax concerns to recognize and reward contibutors. Those concerns needs to be placed on third parties.

Site owners shouldn't have to do much of anything (if anything ever) after their initial ex-gratia installation, apart from maybe adding new features as we deliver them.

Ultimately, we want **site owners** and **contributors** to just worry about *two things*:

1. **Collaborating.**
2. **Making awesome stuff.**

That's our intention anyway.

Let us know what you think in [the issues](https://github.com/svidgen/ex-gratia/issues).
